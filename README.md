# Minesweeper Solver Bot (Python + Selenium)

The goal of this project is an automated bot that plays the beginner board on [minesweeper.online](https://minesweeper.online) using 
rule-based logic. The bot clicks and flags tiles using the same logic a human would apply â€” no random guessing unless necessary. 
It restarts automatically after a loss and continues until it wins.
